Drillbot 6000
An example game created with BIPED

System requirements:
  Java 1.6
  1024x768 or higher resolution


Running:
  Double-click biped.jar to play, or run 'java -jar biped.jar' on the command line.


Editing:
  Edit 'script.pl' (Prolog) to make changes to a game's mechanics.
  The jar can be invoked with an optional command-line argument specifying a
    script other than the default script.pl to load.


Playing Drillbot 6000:
  Read on-screen instructions and note decreasing energy level depicted at the
    bottom of the instruction pane.
  RIGHT-DRAG the instructions panel to move it to the blank space at the
    bottom-left (the pane cannot be dismissed)
  LEFT-CLICK on the green SPACE called 'base' to refuel your robot before mining
  LEFT-CLICK on yellow TOKENS in adjacent spaces to bring rocks into your inventory
  LEFT-CLICK adjacent empty green spaces to move to them
  Bring rocks base to the base and left-click on the base to trade and refuel

  Other visual elements on the screen (tokens and spaces) can be rearranged
    by right-dragging. Note that this does not change the game world; it only
    moves around visual representations.

  If you lose, to restart the game, simply re-run the jar
