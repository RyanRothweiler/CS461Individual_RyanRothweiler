Need some way to specify 'macros'. I'm being forced to retype lots of the same concepts. They could be packaged into reusable pieces.

This...
	event(GoToCostco) - false(HasGas), true(CarAtCostco), false(CarAtHome), false(CarAtBlockbuster) : true(HasGas), false(CarAtCostco).
	event(GoToBlockbuster) - false(HasGas), true(CarAtBlockbuster), false(CarAtCostco) : true(HasGas), false(CarAtBlockbuster).
has a lot of repetition. Need something like MoveCar(CarAtCostco).
Possibly something mutualy exclusive? Car entity which can only be at one location at a time

Methods? Something like
	method(MoveCar) [LOCATION] ??????
No, that won't work. Need some way to say 'CAR can only have ONE LOCATION'

Rename events. They're actually available player moves. 
Events should be triggerable by other events.
