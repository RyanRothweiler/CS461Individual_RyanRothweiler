Strategy game designers have a problem. They cannot quickly iterate on game ideas without the need for extensive systems programming. Game definition languages are a possible solution to this problem. A game definition language allows designers to effectively 'program' a comprehensive rule set which expresses a strategy game. My program, called SandCat, will compile a GDL language text file into a runnable game. This will speed up the game design iteration process as designers will be able to quickly test ideas with minimal work. There are no other products like this in existance. The closest competitors are programs such as Unity, Unreal Engine, or GameMaker. But those programs focus almost entirely on games as software production while SandCat is entirely unique in that it focuses on the game design iterative process.
