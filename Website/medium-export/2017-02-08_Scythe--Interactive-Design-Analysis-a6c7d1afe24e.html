It’s difficult to find any negative reviews of the game and it currently sits as the sixth best game ever on BoardGameGeek. Reviewers are quick to speak highly of its beautiful art and grand world building. Yet after multiple playthroughs, I have mixed feelings on the game. I agree with the general consensus on the production. The art itself is worth the price of entry as its beautiful and unique. Remove all the gamey components and the board itself is a masterful piece of work. Yet Scythe is a board game, not a painting, so it should be judged primarily on the merit of its interactive systems. How do those systems hold up? Not anything special.</p><p name="de05" id="de05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Negative reviews of the game speak about small issues, but I have a few much larger issues that I think have been overlooked. This article will not go into extreme depth on the mechanics, as this is intended for those who have played the game, though many of the criticisms are rooted in fundamental values of interactive systems. So even if you haven’t played the game, I still encourage you to continue reading.</p><p name="4457" id="4457" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My core issue with the game is this. While the art is grand, the interactive merit is lacking. The large amount of discrete mechanics leaves the game with significant width but minimal depth. The game doesn’t appreciate player randomness and this puts players in frustrating positions. And the game ends with multiple annoying rounds of calculation, something that always sours my interest.</p><h3 name="f976" id="f976" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">No appreciation for player randomness</h3><p name="5a42" id="5a42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nearly every review of Scythe contains words about its combat. Reviewers commonly say the threat of combat adds just as much as the combat itself. Before playing Scythe, this concept interested me, but after playing I realize the threat of combat is actually just randomness. The game seems to expect players to predict where combat might take place but this isn’t entirely possible.</p><p name="4c62" id="4c62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Players cannot exactly predict their opponents behavior. Attacks happen suddenly and randomly, so any territory control strategy can be busted apart in one turn by a random attack from an opponent. The problem is not in the success or failure of opponent prediction, instead the issue is that players don’t have time to react to their opponent’s choice. Opponents are nearly always at your doorstep, one turn away from attacking you. The game doesn’t give players the resources to fully defend against all attacks for the entirety of the game, so eventually players must open themselves up to an attack. Whether that attack comes or not is effectively random. Unexpected combat can cost the loser three or four turns, which is not terribly detrimental to a players strategy, but it is harsh enough to be more than just a little annoying.</p><p name="5ff8" id="5ff8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since adjacency is a fluid concept, player prediction is made worse. There are six tunnels on the board which are all considered adjacent. And all factions have unique movement abilities, so only some factions consider certain tiles adjacent, and only specific factions can move across specific rivers, and which factions can move across which rivers is unique for every player. Combine all of that and you realize that an attack can come from nearly any direction at any time. Since adjacency is different across players, it’s even more laborious to calculate all the movement possibilities of your opponents. There is a card supplied which helps alleviate the calculation of these movement possibilities but it doesn’t solve the problem entirely since there are so many total possibilities to consider and defend against. It’s impossible to fully protect yourself through the entire game. This scarcity would be great if players weren’t required to prioritize against a random force.</p><p name="2632" id="2632" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While a random combat encounter might not entirely ruin a players strategy, it is often enough to make them lose. Scythe is a game of efficiency and even a few lost turns can be very frustrating. Combine this with the randomness of attacks and combat can be very angering. Since a player could’ve easily prevented or defended against the attack, this leaves players thinking “Well if I would’ve known that was going to happen I would’ve defended against it”. Players require a buffer zone before randomness effects them otherwise the randomness can decide the outcome of the game. This low buffer randomness is also quite annoying as it feels your choice and strategy has been stolen away from you. Scythe does not seem to acknowledge the effective randomness, instead expecting players to predict their opponents enough to accommodate the randomness into a strategy. Something that isn’t possible.</p><h3 name="5ba7" id="5ba7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A poor end game</h3><p name="b719" id="b719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is a more minor issue but it is annoying enough to speak about. The final few turns are a boring exercise in simple arithmetic. Since players can choose when to end the game, the optimal behavior in the final few turns is to spend minutes after every move and calculate the total score; something that is not quick or simple. If you’re winning then end the game on your next turn. If you’re not winning then stall the game out. Since every other player is also doing the same then the player who is winning will end the game as soon as possible. There is no end game tension. This is such a big problem that the rule book even explicitly outlaws this behavior, but really that hardly helps. The mechanics practically require such calculation behavior so the shoehorned rule doesn’t do anything to relieve the issue. Strategy games should slowly build in tension until the final move. In Scythe tension builds toward late mid game which it then drops off a cliff since the final few turns are filled with a string of mundane calculations.</p><h3 name="ee83" id="ee83" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Discrete mechanics</h3><p name="fd74" id="fd74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My core criticism of Scythe is its disconnected list of mechanics. Scythe has a very large rule book detailing every mechanic but sadly each is sanctioned off into its own corner. The mechanics aren’t one big happy family instead more just acquaintances which merely exchange simple pleasantries. This means the game does not reach the depth necessary to justify its large rule set.</p><p name="dea4" id="dea4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us begin by looking at the workers. The entirety of mechanics and consequences around workers are thus. They can produce resources depending on the board hex they are sitting on. The more workers you have on the board the more expensive it is to produce. Workers cost the attacker popularity if involved in combat. That’s it. There is nothing else to explain with workers. There is very little nuance involved surrounding workers, and little nuance is added when combined with other mechanics. Workers can never get bonuses though the game and they never fluctuate in value depending on the game state. They simply exist to produce resources and the specifics of that production are static and non-reactionary.</p><p name="fdff" id="fdff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each mechanic added should increase nuance and the possible interesting decisions of the other existing mechanics. The worker mechanic, and nearly every mechanic in the game, fails to do this.</p><p name="dd70" id="dd70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Combat is terribly flat as well. So flat that it could be fully automated without player choice. The same with the mechanics around combat cards. Players can use actions to get combat cards, and then can use the cards during combat to increase their chances of winning. Because combat cards are entirely hidden, they are intended to give a bit of randomness to combat. But players rarely risk the chance of failure, they simply wait to fight until they have a sure victory. Thus combat cards add nothing to the game. If players didn’t wait to attack until victory was sure, then the cards would make combat quite random, and that’s a problem also. Combat is either random or completely flat, it never provides interesting decisions.</p><p name="5816" id="5816" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Continuing to look at mechanics, mechs are also terribly flat. They can carry workers and participate in combat. Combat and workers don’t involve many interesting decisions, so this leaves mechs feeling sad and strategically boring. Each mech unlocks a special power which every mech can utilize, and this adds some interesting decisions on the player mat, but this provides nothing interesting to the mechs themselves.</p><p name="4a56" id="4a56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The objective cards are further proof of the shallow pool of game states which results in the disconnected mechanics. Each player has two hidden objectives, which nudges the player down one very specific strategic road. The cards serve to explicitly reward very niche scenarios which otherwise would be pointless. Ideally, the game mechanics themselves would be more elegantly crafted to allow for a large variety of naturally interesting game states. Objective cards don’t add to the decision space, they are simply a way for the designer force states which the rest of the game argues is worthless. As is common with Scythe, objective cards don’t interact with any other mechanics. What if you got a bonus to production when you completed an objective? Or maybe different objective cards give different rewards? Or maybe don’t hide objective cards so players can better predict the movements of their opponents and attempt to stop them? The necessity of the objective cards to add game variety is precisely because the other mechanics fail to create anything interesting.</p><p name="fbef" id="fbef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The player mats are the most interesting mechanic in the game, specifically because they combine, merge, and edit the other mechanics. Actions change in value over the course of the game. And since actions have costs and are bundled in pairs, players are encouraged to plan their next few moves to squeeze maximum efficiency out of each turn. Unfortunately the entirety of the games replayability comes from the asymmetric factions, player mats and starting positions. Combine this with the generally flat mechanic space and you end up with a list of disconnected and explicit strategies for each faction and player mat pair. This creates a meta game of memorizing each strategy for each faction player combination and then just playing that strategy when you play that specific combination.</p><p name="aecd" id="aecd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nearly every mechanic in Scythe only barely succeeds to acknowledge its neighbors. The mechanics don’t branch and intertwine with the other existing mechanics. They don’t combine into a boiling pot of interesting nuanced strategic depth. They are happy to sit flat on the surface hardly speaking with each other.</p><h3 name="8e86" id="8e86" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="4099" id="4099" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">Scythe is a fun thematic experience. It is satisfying to move the well-made pieces around on a such a beautiful board. I’m glad to have it in my collection and I will happily play it in the future. But the mechanics of the game are deceptively shallow. They give the appearance of depth because of their mature theming and extreme polish, but this polish reveals the fundamental lack of strategic nuance. The mechanics are so disconnected that they seem to entirely ignore each other. Scythe is the kind of game you get when you lack a substantial and interesting mechanical core. All of the fat was trimmed off the game in an attempt to get right into the meat, unfortunately there was little meat, only a skeleton with some absolutely stunning tattoos.</p></div></div></section>
