Goals for SandCat.

1. Archiveable. 
	Something written in SandCat should still be playable in 10 years. 
2. Expressive. 
	SandCat should be expressive enough to write something of decent rule complexity within an hour. 
	SandCat should be able to express a highly diverse set of games.
3. Light.  
	SandCat should be light and efficient. The purpose is quick design iteration times so the designer should not be waiting for SandCat.
